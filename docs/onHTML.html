<!-- Because the HTML files are stored inside a folder [pages]  you have to use [../] before the [assets] folder name 
use patter attribute in inputs  -->
<!-- To style an input:file, hide the input it self and style the label, and don't forget to link the label with the input to respond as it is the input itself  -->

<!-- Accept specific type of files by using input:file control -->
<!-- 
    Certainly! The `accept` attribute in the `<input type="file">` element is used to specify the types of files that the server can accept. It is a comma-separated list of unique file type specifiers. Here are some common values for the `accept` attribute along with the file types they represent:

1. **Image Files:**
   - `accept="image/*"`: Accepts all image types (JPEG, PNG, GIF, etc.).
   - `accept="image/jpeg, image/png"`: Accepts only JPEG and PNG image files.

2. **Audio Files:**
   - `accept="audio/*"`: Accepts all audio types (MP3, WAV, OGG, etc.).
   - `accept="audio/mp3, audio/wav"`: Accepts only MP3 and WAV audio files.

3. **Video Files:**
   - `accept="video/*"`: Accepts all video types (MP4, WebM, OGG, etc.).
   - `accept="video/mp4, video/webm"`: Accepts only MP4 and WebM video files.

4. **Document Files:**
   - `accept="application/pdf"`: Accepts only PDF files.
   - `accept="application/msword, application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document"`: Accepts Microsoft Word document files (DOC, DOCX).

5. **Text Files:**
   - `accept="text/plain"`: Accepts plain text files.

6. **All Files:**
   - `accept="*"`: Accepts all file types.

It's important to note that the `accept` attribute is a hint to the browser and does not prevent users from selecting files of other types. It primarily serves to provide guidance and improve the user experience. The actual file type validation should be done on the server-side to ensure security and data integrity.
